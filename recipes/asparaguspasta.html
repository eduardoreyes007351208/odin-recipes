        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped (about 1 tablespoon)</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high. Add pappardelle, and cook <br> until al dente, about 6 minutes. Drain pasta over a heatproof bowl, reserving 1 <br> 1/2 cups cooking water; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Add shallot and garlic, and <br> cook, stirring constantly, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add asparagus and 1/2 <br> cup of the reserved cooking water. Cook, stirring occasionally, until asparagus is <br> bright green and tender, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add butter, cream, lemon zest and juice, salt, black pepper, crushed red pepper, <br> and remaining 1 cup cooking water to skillet. Stir in cooked pasta, and cook over <br> medium-low, gently stirring with tongs and sprinkling in Parmesan cheese, until <br> sauce thickens and coats pasta, about 2
            minutes. Divide pasta evenly among 4 bowls, <br> and garnish with basil and additional Parmesan. </li>
    </ol>
